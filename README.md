# Sonar

**Description:**

For this project I was tasked to create a embedded program that will control our sonar device and display the distance on a LCD screen. The goals for the project were to:

  1. Create a timer that will allow our sonar device to function
  2. Create a function that will convert the count to a distance
  3. Display the Sonar Data to the LCD screen

**Features:**

The features this project utlized the supplied sonar device, the onboard registers, and the LCD screen. Utlizing C, I was able to create a low level program that would allow our sonar device to work properly. What makes this program unique is the utlization of the timers to allow our device to work.

The periphals utlized were:

  * Enhance Capture Timer
  * External Sonar Device
  * LCD screen

**Programming Language:** C

**Libraries/Frameworks:** Timer Registers

**Environment:** CodeWarrior
